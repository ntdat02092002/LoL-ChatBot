Patch 14.19 Notes

Elise
Passive spiderlings now always regen when resummoned and jump on Q cast. Human E now reveals stealthed units and can now be redirected via flash. Spider E buff now applies on cast and can be recast to immediately drop back. R cooldown decreased.

We wanted to give Elise a bit of love with some small updates on spells that are easy to modernize. This included simplifying Rappel rules around the buff it provides, giving Elise an option to drop down early if she wishes to, and making Cocoon a more reliable play making spell at higher skill levels. R cooldown should really help her when trying to both roam in Spider form, transform to human to start a skirmish and then get back on her eight legs to keep fighting.

Spiderlings always regenerate to full health when resummoned
Spiderlings jump on Q spell cast rather than waiting for Elise to land on target

You can now Flash during the cast to redirect Cocoon
E - Rappel
Rappel Buff is now always applied after descending
After 1 second in the air, Elise can recast E or target the ground to immediately drop back at her location
R - Spider Form
Cooldown: 4 ⇒ 3

K'Sante
Base Attack Range reduced. All abilities adjusted.

 While K'Sante is intended to be a difficult champion, in the hands of skilled players he offers high levels of safety, reliability, and general power regardless of his circumstances or the relative skill of his enemies. This has made him a Pro staple since release at the cost of his playability for most players (a tale as old as time). Our aim, however, is not to make K'Sante an easy champion, or one that anybody can pick up and play. He should absolutely be a more difficult champion who rewards deep mastery and experience. He should not be a champion who top-tier players can reliably pick into any situation, even if they aren't great at K'Sante specifically. When a K'Sante player pops off, it should be clear to all that this success was earned through superior play.
With these changes, we're asking K'Sante to commit to fights and actively outplay his opponents, taking risks and testing his skill against theirs. His Q and W are less reliable, but players who can consistently land their spells regardless should find even more success. His lane safety has been reduced and compensated with more power to actively win, rather than passively scale. We're also solidifying the roles of his two forms as Warden and Skirmisher—he should be excellent at protecting his allies as a defensive tank, and thrive as a fighter in the smaller-scale encounters he can set up with his R. His All Out E has been reshaped to fit the frequent repositioning needed in tense 1v1s with decreased cooldown and increased speed, rather than increased range that's best used for diving squishy backline champions in teamfights. The damage profile of his ultimate form has also been updated to focus on target-agnostic damage—as a monster hunter, he should be better equipped to cut down enemies of all sizes.
Overall, we expect changes of this magnitude to require some relearning. We appreciate your patience and dedication, and hope you enjoy the update. Get out there and make Nazumah proud, hunters.

Tristana
Basic Attack Range, Damage, and Attack Speed Ratio increased. AD growth, HP Regen growth, and Armor growth decreased. Passive range decreased at higher levels. Q Attack Speed increased. W slow decreased and duration changed to a flat value. W AD ratio added. E damage profile reworked to value crit. R cooldown changed to a flat value. R stun added. R damage profile reworked to account for AD ratio.

Tristana was sadly locked away in Pro jail earlier this year but now that the season is over with this patch, it's time to free her. Our goals here are two fold: First, we want to buff her, as Tristana is weak relative to other champions in her class. Second, we want to make her strengths more attuned to the bottom lane as opposed to mid lane. To do this, we're lowering the value of experience, raising the value of gold, offering a few quality-of-life changes, and helping her play out early cooperative lanes better.
The Explosive Charge passive change should make it harder for her to have automatic push in mid lane, while in bot lane she can now cleanly last hit 5/6 minions under her turret, as the previous tuning would immediately ruin every melee minion after just last hitting one and break the last ranged minion after killing two. Tristana players may want to delay Rank 2 of E to preserve this change. The R stun duration will help Tristana's ultimate apply full crowd control value even when her opponents are pushed into a wall (much more common in bot lane), as the knockback debuff could end early. The E active change asks her to invest more in late game crit itemization, meaning she can't go for selfish one-item spikes to try to take over solo lanes. And finally, she's getting AD ratio additions while reducing the value of leveling up via both base stats and ability ranks.

Vladimir
W healing effectiveness reduced against minions.

W-max Vladimir has become a fairly common build. While it isn't very good (Vladimir's win rate has actually decreased due to its discovery), the gameplay quality is extremely poor since he sustains so much off of every wave. This patch we're bringing the minion healing down a fair bit, though still somewhat higher than it was before 14.12's buffs. We've also updated the tooltip to be clearer about the heal's functionality.
W - Sanguine Pool
Healing is now 60% effective against minions
Updated tooltip to clarify that healing is not mitigated by target resistances
